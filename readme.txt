Here you can find three cases:
1) plantComp_balance - describes the model behavior where the two species can coexist, and none of them win the competition completely
2) plantComp_c_wins - describes the model behavior where the c species (dominant) win the conmpetition
3) plantComp_d_wins - describes the model behavior where the d species win the competition

Each case includes 4 files:
1) xml configuration
2) zip file with model definition, initial values, and include file with macros
3) shell script to run simulation using the RISE client
4) draw log with simulation results, which can be easily animated using CD++ Modeler.

To run any of the models, you need to have RISE client on your machine:
1) Download the RISE client and install it
2) Copy the content of this folder to the RISE installation directory
3) Run one of the 3 .bat files to simulate the desired case

Also included Color.pal file, which contains model palette.
Detailed model description and analysis of simulation results are depicted in the PlantCompReport.doc
The most interesting results of simulation were captured as  short videos: PlantComp_c_wins, PlantComp_d_wins, PlantComp_balance.
